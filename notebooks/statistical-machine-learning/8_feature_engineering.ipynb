    "- Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) measures how much a feature's variance is increased due to multicollinearity, which is when features are highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "- High VIF means the feature is highly correlated with others, which can cause problems in the model.\n",
    "- Multicollinearity may not affect the model’s accuracy directly, but model interpretation and the stability of coefficients will be negatively impacted.\n",
